To give insight of the offered project by PT BIB, and in support for PT Ranadityo Sukses Makmur for the coating job, we initiate a project survey on site on South Borneo. As one of the leading coal producer in Indonesia, PT BIB demand professionalism from their vendors, including contractors. Which drives us to held a proper preparation for tender process as detail as possible.

Along with other professionals, Mr. Muh. Munif and Mr. Kholil of mechanical engineering work specialist, Mr. Riyanto of grouting and concrete work specialist, Mr. Yulian Perdana of coating specialist, Mr. Satrio Sayoga of cathodic specialist and as PT RSM representative, we held a 3 days visit to gain more insight of the project, and make a rough planning for the tender proposal.

Hopefully PT BIB put their trust on us and put themselves a wonderful addition to our customers list who satisfied with our work.
